# cm

Implementation of the Columnar Machine

The module should be called as a Python script:

$ python2 cm.py

The script figures out the necessary parameters (e.g., the number of
groups), substitutes them into the configuration files, and runs the
CM algorithm with the autoencoder pretraining step on all the datasets
named in the ``datasets`` variable.
